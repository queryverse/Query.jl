If you have a question or are unsure if the behavior you're experiencing
is a bug, please search or post to the Data domain on the julia Discourse
site: https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/data. I use the GitHub
issue tracker for bug reports and feature requests only.

Thanks for contributing to Query.jl!
